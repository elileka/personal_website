I am an independent scientist, working under the name ELKMO. 
My clients include the [Steinegger lab] (https://steineggerlab.com/en/) at [SNU] (https://www.snu.ac.kr/).

Before that I was a postdoc with [Dr. Johannes SÃ¶ding] (https://www.mpibpc.mpg.de/soeding) at [MPIBPC] (https://www.mpinat.mpg.de/en), where I developed tools for the analysis of eukaryotic metagenomic data.  

Before that, I did my PhD at [TAU] (https://english.tau.ac.il/) under the joint supervision of [Prof. Tal Pupko] (https://m.tau.ac.il/~talp/) and [Prof. Itay Mayrose] (https://www.tau.ac.il/~itaymay/). My work focused on statistical techniques in molecular evolution.
